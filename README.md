# Fully clickable card

## Overview
A common pattern seen across the web is a card with a button-shaped call to action. Often times, the entire card is clickable, and when clicked, the action is performed. In this exercise, please build out this pattern using `references/new-orleans-card.png` for design guidelines.

## Requirements
- This should link to https://www.neworleans.com/
- The entire card should be clickable.
- Any image can be used.
- Donâ€™t get too hung up on measuring spacing or matching exact colors; use your best guesses.

### Further considerations
- Use valid markup. The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) can be used to test your work.
- The card should have only one focusable element.
